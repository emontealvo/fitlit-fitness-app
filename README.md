## Abstract:
FitLit is a Mod 2 application for Turing students. 

FitLit tracks the fitness of a user, in terms of their activity, sleep and hydration. Building this application encouraged collaboration and communication skills, refining paired programming processes, further exploration of CSS concepts learned in Mod 1, a deeper understanding of classes and the manipulation of data, and the use of OOP and TDD. In the complete application, a user is generated at random, and all information related to their fitness and friends is displayed. See below.
